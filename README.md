# SAR Image Generation with GANs

This repository hosts the code and resources for the "SAR Image Generation based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Target Characteristics" project. This project explores the application of various GAN architectures to generate Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to enhance target recognition algorithms under limited data conditions. This is my bachelor degree project.

## Introduction

This project evaluates the effectiveness of several GAN architectures for the synthesis of SAR images, particularly under conditions of data scarcity. This research is crucial for applications where SAR data is limited due to the high costs associated with its acquisition. The GANs tested include DCGAN, WGAN-GP, WGAN-DIV, SNGAN, Enhanced SNGAN, and VAE-GAN, each offering unique advantages in terms of image quality and training stability.
